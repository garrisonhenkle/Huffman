Issues or Limitations
-------------------
    -   most literal characters do not work (\t, \b, etc.)
        ** Note: \n is the only exception **

    -   space characters can only be parsed when written as "space"

    -   Occasionally the tree will be built with either only left children or right children, leading to
        some differences between the output and the ideal Huffman Code
